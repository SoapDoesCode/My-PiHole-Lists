# My-PiHole-Lists

This repository is where I plan to host my PiHole lists, including both Blacklists and Whitelists

Blacklists can be added to your PiHole setup as normal
Whitelists will require manually copying each URL manually, however there won't be many of those so there isn't much to worry about!
